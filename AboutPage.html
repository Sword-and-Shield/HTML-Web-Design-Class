        <h2 class = "dog">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p class = "cat" style="text-indent: 60px;">My name is Alexander Shepard. I was born in Portsmouth, Virginia and grew up in San Diego, California. <br>
        I'd shake hands, but unfortunately this is just a website! Pleasure to meet you!</p>

        <h3 class = "dog">Education</h3>
        
        <p class = "cat">I am a student at San Diego State University with a double major in Management Information Systems and Japanese. 
            When I first enrolled, I was going for a degree in Electrical Engineering, but found that IT and Japanese are my true passion. 
            I have led multiple projects with my fellow classmates, leading meetings and helping to delegate tasks.
            I have also taken a CompTIA A+ course, where I got to learn networking and how certain devices (like a switch) work. 
            The skills I have developed include web development, systems analysis and design, data management (Microsoft SQL server),
             and troubleshooting to name a few. I am currently interested in learning more about Information Technology and how I fit in.
            I am fascinated in the idea of working with hardware and software, whether itâ€™s fixing a computer, working with a switch,
             developing websites, or configuring internet protocol addresses. I would love to apply my knowledge in a practical setting!</p>

        <p class = "cat">My hobbies include drawing, story-writing, anime, and video games!<br>Here are some of my favorites:</p>

            <p class = "cat">This is Ice Cube (left) and Drink (right). I have created many characters,
                but these two are my favorites! As you can see in the picture, they love drinking soda!<br><br>
                The story so far:<br>
                Drink is a 21 year old college student majoring in nutritional health. Ironically, she's
                addicted to soda, one of the unhealthiest beverages in the world! Suddenly, Drink's mother, Cherry, and Ice Cube's mother, Mizu, 
                stops by unannounced to drop off Ice Cube, a 16 year old kleptomaniac. Stuck with having to balance college life and an unruly teenager,
                Drink spends her day-to-day life being annoyed by this little brat, who keeps stealing her soda. That's right, this picture is a 
                very rare occurrence.</p>

                its blend of comedy, action, and heartfelt moments. I'd love to explain the story, but I'll leave that up to the experts.

                <p class = "cat">This is currently my favorite video game. Naraka Bladepoint is a battle royale game with it's own campaign mode.
                    There are multiple "heroes" you cn play as and they all have their own abilities or powers. The combat is melee and ranged
                    with parry mechanics to go with it. It can be a pretty addictive game and it's really fun with friends!
